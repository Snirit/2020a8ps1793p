# PS1 2022


Collaborative, documentation as a code and test driven development

## Collaborative

* Create private github repository

* Repository structure
    ```bash
    assets/
    data/
    dist/
    docs/
    scripts/
    src/
    README.md
    index.html
    package.json
    .gitignore
    ```
* Shared gdrive collaboration
    * Add any artifacts apart from code like excelsheets, ppts, docs, pdf etc in the shared gdrive in the given directory structure
* 2 High level functional groups
    * Web based apps
    * Mobile based apps
* Each functional group can further have individual or teams
* Each individual or team work in collaboration and support other teams/individual for any queries

## Documentation as a code

Document using markdown (.md) files in `docs/` folder of the repository.


* `docs/<topic-name>.md` examples:
    * `docs/markdown.md`
    * `docs/shell-script.md`
    * `docs/webcomponent.md`

    * https://www.11ty.dev/
    * https://docusaurus.io/

* Summarize the work in `docs/report.md` on weekly basis
* Add the the hyperlinks of <element></element>xcelsheets, ppts in the `docs/report.md`
* Extra (optional fun activity):
    * PPT using markdown files


### APIs

* Create an excelsheet (.xlxs) in the **shared gdrive** to list down all the APIs and end points and brief description of API functionalities
* Refer [mappls-api](https://github.com/mappls-api) for details on the API


## Learning Objectives


* To work in a shared collaborative way as a team and individual
* To use apply the industrial trend of documentation as a code and documentation driven development to a mini project
* To prioritise, report work and deliverables
* To develop analytical thinking and reasoning approach on identification of tech needed for the development project
* Key technologies exposure on some of these technologies
    * Node and NPM based development
    * HTML5, CSS3
    * HTML Webcomponents
    * Geospatials, Maps and location tech
    * APIs, SDKs, REST APIs, Swagger
    * WebGL, vector maps
    * Android, Android SDKs
    * Jamstack, SSG - docusaurus, 11ty
    * Markdown
    * git, github, github pages
